# Terovania Jira Dark Theme

To use this, you must install the Stylus browser extension:    
[Stylus for FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/)   
[Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=de)   
[Stylus for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/stylus/)

After that, click on this badge to install the style:   
[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-285959.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EaranMaleasi/Terovania-Jira-dark-theme/master/Terovania_Jira_Dark_Theme.user.css)

The style will then be updated automatically as long as you have stylus installed in your browser. Feel free to open issues for anything that I've missed.
